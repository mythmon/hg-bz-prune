# hg-bz-prune

This is a tool to support my workflow of using Mercurial to work on Firefox
bugs. It's not meant to be generally useful for others.

This is also very over engineered. The entire thing could probably be a 10 line
shell script. I'm using it as a test bed to learn more about error handling,
logging, and other production quality Rust techniques.
